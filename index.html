		<h2>Our Wedding Info</h2>
<!-- 		<h4>Our Story</h4>
		<p class="our_info">
			We met on a hot summer evening in the river town of New Hope, PA. The night was festive for Jackie as it was her 24th birthday, and she was celebrating with her close cousin Casey Hansen. Their celebration led to a chance encounter amongst friends, and we were introduced. The introduction seemed like any other to an outsider: a simple exchange of names, a formal handshake and a curtious 'nice to meet you'. But to us, this introduction caused the spark that lit the fire and that fire has burned for 3 amazing years.

		<h2>The Bridesmaids</h2>
		<p>The beautiful ladies of the wedding</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<img src="http://content.jackieandseangetmarried.com/images/transparent.gif" id="jen_pic">
				<h3>Jen Read</h3>
				<p>Jen and Jackie met as lone freshman in college. They immediately became friends and spent the next three years living together. Though Jen and Jackie had very different sleeping patterns and it almost made them split ways, they stuck it out and are still best friends.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<img src="http://content.jackieandseangetmarried.com/images/transparent.gif" id="meg_d_pic">
				<h3>Megan Daniels</h3>
				<p>Megan and Jackie became best friends in third grade. They were inseparable until the day they were ripped apart when Jackie's family moved to New Jersey. They have remained extremely close over the past 12 years, making it a point to visit each other as often as possible.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<img src="http://content.jackieandseangetmarried.com/images/transparent.gif" id="lauren_e_pic">
				<h3>Lauren Eleuteri</h3>
				<p>Lauren and Jackie were the two new girls starting high school. During their Spanish class freshman year, they immediately realized they had found someone as funny as themselves and spent the next four years sharing a locker, walking each other to class and doing anything they could to be together.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<img src="http://content.jackieandseangetmarried.com/images/transparent.gif" id="lauren_k_pic">
				<h3>Lauren Kurisko</h3>
				<p>Lauren and Jackie met about 6 years ago when Lauren started dating Jackie's brother, Brad. Jackie did not hold that against her and they are now sisters in law and love each other a lot! They have similar senses of humor and both love to nap.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<img src="http://content.jackieandseangetmarried.com/images/transparent.gif" id="meg_l_pic">
				<h3>Megan Lanouette</h3>
				<p>Megan took Jackie under her wing when she realized Jackie was the new girl in high school.  They had too much fun in high school and continue to do so as neighbors in Lambertville.  While they often disagree about things such as how loud your music should be played and how fast you should drive, they have remained great friends. </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<img src="http://content.jackieandseangetmarried.com/images/transparent.gif" id="googs_pic">
				<h3>Jessica "Googs" Letteney</h3>
				<p>Googs and Jackie also became great friends in high school. They realized early on that they were practically neighbors and spent their time together carpooling, riding bikes and taking long walks.</p>
